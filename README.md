AIM-
To practice fundamental C++ programming concepts including loops, nested loops, conditional statements, and pattern generation. This compilation serves as a mini lab to strengthen output formatting and logical flow using simple code constructs.

ðŸ“š Theory
ðŸ”¹ Loops in C++
Loops allow repeated execution of code blocks. The most common types are for, while, and do-while loops. Nested loops (loops inside other loops) are often used for pattern generation.

ðŸ”¹ Conditional Statements
if, else, and switch are used to apply conditions and control the flow of the program.

ðŸ”¹ Output Formatting
cout along with manipulators like spaces (" ") and newline (endl) are used to control the appearance of printed output. This is especially important when generating structured patterns or tables.

ðŸ”¹ Pattern Printing
Using nested loops with counters, programmers can generate a variety of number and star patterns. These exercises help develop control over flow structures and attention to detail in logic.

ðŸ”§ Program Collection

âœ… 1. Print Even Numbers from 0 to 10
Purpose: Display even numbers using a for loop and an if condition.
Logic: Numbers divisible by 2 are considered even.
âœ… 2. Triangle Number Pattern (Incremental Numbers)
Purpose: Print a triangle pattern with increasing numbers row-wise.
Logic: Use nested loops; maintain a counter to increment and print values
âœ…3. Simple Repetition Using a for Loop
Purpose: Print a message multiple times using a basic for loop.
âœ… 4. Right-Angled Triangle Star Pattern
Purpose: Display a basic increasing triangle of stars.
Logic: Outer loop controls rows, inner loop controls stars per row.
âœ… 5. Inverted Triangle Star Pattern
Purpose: Print a reversed star triangle starting from the largest row.
âœ… 6. Center-Aligned Pyramid Pattern
Purpose: Display a pyramid-shaped pattern with center alignment.
Logic: Left spaces plus stars with spacing for structure

ðŸ§  Conclusion
These basic C++ programs reinforce understanding of:
Loop control and nesting
Output alignment and pattern creation
Incrementing logic and conditional checks
